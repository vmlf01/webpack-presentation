short description:
  - module bundler
  - transforms modules with dependencies into static assets (chunks)
  - chunks can be
    - entry chunk (contains runtime)
    - normal chunk
    - initial chunk

- everything is an object... sorry, MODULE!
  - isolated scope, no unwanted global polution


who created it
  - Tobias Koppers aka @sokra, Germany
  - sometime around 2012
  - 1.0.0 - 19 Feb 2014


webpack main contents:
  - bundler (npm install devpack)
  - webpack-dev-server (npm install devpack-dev-server)
      - serves static files from content-base and bundle from memory
      - hot module replacement


architecture

sources + dependencies -> loaders -> modules -> compilation + plug-ins -> chunks

  - sources/dependencies
    - supports CommonJS, AMD, ES6, CSS, Coffeescript, Images, LESS, etc.
  - loaders
    - used to pre-process files
      - exports
      - script
      - cofee, babel, etc.
      - file
      - url
      - css
      - style
      - html
      - indexhtml
  - modules
    - isolated scope, no unwanted global polution
  - plug-ins
    - register to run on compiler pipeline events (run, make, emit, failed, etc.)
  - assets
    - emited by the compilation process
  - chunks/entry-points
    - final artifacts of the bundler


settings and configuration
  - CLI/inline
  - webpack.config.js


samples
  - static site

// one entry chunk
var webpack = require("webpack");

module.exports = {
  entry: {
    app: "./app.js"
  },
  output: {
    filename: "bundle.js"
  }
};
